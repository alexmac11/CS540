# Lottery Scheduling Simulation

## Overview
This program simulates a basic lottery scheduling algorithm. Processes are assigned lottery tickets, and the scheduler randomly selects a ticket to determine the next process to run.

## Requirements
- Python

## Functionality
- `Process` class: Represents a process with a unique identifier and lottery tickets.
- `Scheduler` class: Manages the lottery scheduling algorithm, including adding processes, allocating lottery tickets, and selecting the next process to run.
- Uses a random number generator to simulate the lottery ticket selection process.
